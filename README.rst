Charliecloud fork for Juan J. Durillo
-------------------------------------

To read what Charlie Cloud is about check the original github repository https://github.com/hpc/charliecloud

This fork of Charlie Cloud provides some extra functionality I need on top of the original Charlie Cloud container. 
More specifically, it maintans the environment variables defined within a Dockerfile, and were therefore available 
within the Docker image.
